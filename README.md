fusonic/webapp is a library that supports you in creating meta information for your web application from a "code first"
approach. While you define your meta information once, fusonic/webapp will create a
[Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) and
[meta tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) for you. It maintains the newest standards
 in meta information that should be provided by progressive web apps.
 
## Requirements

fusonic/webapp is supported on PHP 5.5 and up.

## Installation & usage

$ composer require fusonic/webapp
